ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The Resume Screening project processes and classifies resumes based on their content using machine learning models. It applies text cleaning, tokenization, vectorization, and model training to achieve high classification accuracy. The classifier helps in sorting resumes into categories like Data Science, HR, Software Engineer, etc.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
ðŸ§¬ Dataset
| Column   | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Resume   | Raw resume text                      |
| Category | Target label (e.g. Data Science, HR) |

ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

1.Clean text (remove URLs, emojis, punctuation)
2.Tokenize and remove stopwords (using NLTK)
3.Encode labels using LabelEncoder
4.Vectorize text using TfidfVectorizer

ðŸ§  Model Details
| Component     | Method                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Vectorization | TF-IDF (max\_features=5000)               |
| Classifier    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)                 |
| Strategy      | One-vs-Rest                               |
| Evaluation    | Accuracy, F1-score, classification report |
